# üêç My Python Learning Projects

Welcome to my repository! This is where I collect all the small Python projects and exercises I create to learn and improve my skills.

## About This Repository

This repository aims to store the various Python scripts and programs I develop. Each folder or file is a complete project, usually accompanied by a short comment explaining its purpose and the concepts I explored.

The projects included here are often related to subjects I'm studying, such as text analysis, creating graphical user interfaces (with libraries like `CustomTkinter`), or data manipulation.

## Content

You will find different projects, organized as follows:

-   **`Random Number`**: "Find the secret number between 1 and 10!"
-   **`File Reader`**: "File Analyzer"
-   ... and other projects to come!

## How to Use This Repository

If you want to explore the code, you can:

1.  **Clone the repository**: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git`
2.  **Navigate to a project**: Open a project folder (`cd my_project_folder`)
3.  **Run the script**: Execute the Python file with the command `python script_name.py`

## Technologies Used

-   **Python**
-   **Libraries**: The specific libraries for each project (such as `tkinter`, `customtkinter`, `os`, `random`, etc.) are mentioned in the respective codes.

## Contact

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me via my GitHub profile.

**Note**: This repository is a personal learning project. The code may not be optimized and is subject to change over time.
Not everything is done by me (the graphical interfaces are made by an AI while I learn how to use them properly).
